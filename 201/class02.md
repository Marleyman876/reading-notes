+ # Headings `<h1></h1>`

HTML has 6 "levels" of headings. h1 is used for the main heading while the others an be considered sub headings. Beacuse of this concept the browser usually displays h1 as the largest heading with the size of the heading becoming smaller the more it progresses. Try it for yourself [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_headers). 

+ # Paragaphs `<p></p>`

Paragrapghs are defined by the `<p></p>` tags. By default browsers will show paragraphs in a new line once the website is published or is opened in a browser.

# CSS Introduction 

Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS is the language used within HTML to fornmat, color and add style to a webpage.CSS helps the webpage to "come alive and add character to the page in terms of color and styling. 

Accodring to the author Jon Duckett "In order to undertand how CSS works, think of every html element as having an invisible box around it." CSS allows the designer to establish rules that will affect how the contents on a webpage is presented. 

CSS can be added to a website in various ways, such as using an external CSS link. In this menthod a separate CSS page is created and referenced withing the HTML documents using an `href=` tag which specifies where the style is located for that specific content. 

In internal CSS the styling is done inside the HTML document by placing the the CSS coding between the `<style></style>` tags. There are multiple selectors within CSS, please follow this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) to practice a CSS tutorial and learn more about CSS selectors.
