## HTML

In creating a website you can add things such as tags to provide extra meaning and allow the browsers to properly structure the page to for user understanding. HTML uses differnt tags some of the most popular ones are headings, paragraphs, bold & italics, to see more html tags click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).

+ ## Headings `<h1></h1>`

HTML has 6 "levels" of headings. h1 is used for the main heading while the others an be considered sub headings. Beacuse of this concept the browser usually displays h1 as the largest heading with the size of the heading becoming smaller the more it progresses. Try it for yourself [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_headers).

+ ### Paragaphs `<p></p>`

Paragrapghs are defined by the `<p></p>` tags. By default browsers will show paragraphs in a new line once the website is published or is opened in a browser.

## CSS Introduction

Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS is the language used within HTML to fornmat, color and add style to a webpage.CSS helps the webpage to "come alive and add character to the page in terms of color and styling.

Accodring to the author Jon Duckett "In order to undertand how CSS works, think of every html element as having an invisible box around it." CSS allows the designer to establish rules that will affect how the contents on a webpage is presented.

CSS can be added to a website in various ways, such as using an external CSS link. In this menthod a separate CSS page is created and referenced withing the HTML documents using an `href=` tag which specifies where the style is located for that specific content.

In internal CSS the styling is done inside the HTML document by placing the the CSS coding between the `<style></style>` tags. There are multiple selectors within CSS, please follow this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) to practice a CSS tutorial and learn more about CSS selectors.

## Javascript

Javascript uses variables abbreviated `var`. A variable is is a named reference to a value. Variables are declared in Javascript using three ways: var, let and const.

+ var declares a variable to initialize a value
+ let declares a blocked socope
+ const declares a blocked scope, read-only name constant.

More information about variables are available at this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#declarations).

## Decision and Loops

Decisions can be made at several places within a script. In javascript you use if/else conditions to help in decision making. There are several comparison tools that can be used in comparison and decision making. Some of these operators are:

+ == "equal to"
+ === "strict equal to"
+ != "not equal to"

For more operators please click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators). 

### Loops

Loops check for a condition and if it returns true a particular block of code will run. Loops will check contiously depending on the condition until it returns false. There are three types of loops:

+ for loops
For loops are pretty common and runs for a specific number of times which is set by the developer.

+ while loop
A while loop will run until the condition stated in the loop is met

+ do while
A do while loop is very similar to a while loop but will run the conditions inside the "{}" at least once even if it evaluates to false.

More information on loops are found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration).
