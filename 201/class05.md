# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Images

There are many reasons to add images to a webpage. Some Images can be logo's, illustrations or chart. There are several things to consider when adding images to your page, such as placement, image size and image format.

To add an image to and html document the `<img></img>` element, within that img element you need to identify the source of the image, this done by adding "src=link or folder location" within the image element. You can also add title, description and edit the dimensions of the image withing the 'img tag. As mentioned before knowing where to add your image on your webpage will affect how it is displayed.

Color brings things to life, therefore having a good color scheme for a webpage is important. There are different places to add color on a web page some of these places include [foreground color](https://www.w3resource.com/css/color/introduction.php), [background color](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.asp).

## Text

Properties that help us to control how the text appears on a page can be split into two groups:

* Those that directly affect the font and the appearance of the text, including the type face of the text such as it being bold, or italic.

* Those that would have the same affect no matter what font or color is applied. There are different styles that we can add to text on a webpage, you can also addd color to text and have it aligned any way you want on the webpage.
