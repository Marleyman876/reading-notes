# Displaying Data

Displaying data is an essential part of being a developer. Charts are, according to [webdesignerdepot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/) by far the most efficient way to display data using the chart.js tools. Chart.js is a Javascript plugin tool that can be added to your text editor to help with displaying charts in a more efficient way.

## Canvas Element

* Has only two attributes `width` and `height`
* `id` attribute isn't the specific to `<canvas>` but is one of the global HTML Attributes.

## Fallback Content

The `<canvas>` element differs from an `<img>` tag in that, like for `<video>, <audio>, or <picture>` elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers.[MDN WebDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage).
