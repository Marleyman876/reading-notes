# Table 

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results. 

A `<tr></tr>` element is used to crete a table. You indicate the start of each row using the opening `<tr>` tag. The tr stands for table row. It is followed by one or more `<td>` elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a
closing `</tr>` tag. More reading on tables available [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp). 

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

In a function definition, `this` refers to the owner of the function.
For example, `this.lastName` means the lastName property of this object.

JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp)).

Objects in Javascript is an standalone entity. Objects have properties which can be defined by assigning it a value. For example. 

`var myCar = new Object();`
`myCar.make = 'Ford';`
`myCar.model = 'Mustang';`
`myCar.year = 1969;`
