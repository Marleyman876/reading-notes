# HTML/CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is how you add sparkle to a webpage. Css treats each HTML as if its own box, there are two types of boxes, an inline box and a block-level box. A [block-level](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) box starts on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, inline boxes flow in between surrounding text.

## Controlling the Position of Elements

CSS has positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page. Some of these positions include:

* [Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)

* [Positionings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning).

## Layout

because of screen sizes display resolutions vary. To remedy this issue there are two types of layouts that can be used i.e:

* [Fixed layout](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/creating-a-fixed-width-layout-with-css/)

* [fluid Layout](https://techterms.com/definition/fluid_layout#:~:text=A%20fluid%20layout%20is%20a,%2C%20two%2C%20or%20three%20columns.)
