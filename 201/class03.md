# Lists

There are different occasions why we use lists in coding, within HTML there are three different types of lists:

+ ## Ordered List

An ordered list has items listed sequentially and numbered in formats of 1,2,3... or in roman or alphabetically a,b,c.
An or dered lis in Html is indicated by the tags `<ol></ol>`. More infomation about ordered list is provided [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp).

+ ## Unordered List

An unorded list uses bullet points rather than characters that indicate an order.Unorded list arre started by the   `<ul></ul>` tags. More infomation about ordered list is provided [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_unordered.asp).

+ ## Definition List

A definition list is made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. A definition list is indicated in HTML by adding the parent `<dl></dl>` and adding the  `<dt></dt>` tags to define the terms name and the `<dd></dd>` tag to describe each term.

+ ## Nested List

A nested list is a worthy mention her as it is a list that appears as a element within another list, or a simplier way of explaining is its like a list within a list. 

# Boxes

All HTML elements can be considered boxes. In CSS a [box](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) essentally wraps around the html and consists of margins, borders, padding and the content we woul dlike published on our rendered webpage. Using CSS we can do thins like edit the height of this box, add [border-style](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp), [border-width](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_width.), and much more styling. so if we look at each element essentially in our HTML we can think of it as a box our main, our h1,h2 and so forth are all boxes that hold the content of our html and using css we can style the content in these boxes as well as style the box itself.
