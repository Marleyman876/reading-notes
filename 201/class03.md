# Lists

There are different occasions why we use lists in coding, within HTML there are three different types of lists:

+ ## Ordered List

An ordered list has items listed sequentially and numbered in formats of 1,2,3... or in roman or alphabetically a,b,c.
An or dered lis in Html is indicated by:
`<ol>`
  `<li> Numreo uno<li>`
  `<li>Numero Dos</li>`
  `</ol>`
In the example above  `<ol></ol>` is the  and `<li></li> is the child. More infomation about ordered list is provided [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp).

+ ## Unordered List

An unorded list uses bullet points rather than characters that indicate an order. In the example below  `<ul></ul>` is the element and `<li></li> is the tag that tags the list items.
`<ul>
<li> Numreo uno<li>
<li>Numero Dos</li>
</ul>`

+ ## Definition List

A definition list is made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. A definition list is indicated in HTML by adding the parent `<dl></dl>` and adding the  `<dt></dt>` tags to define the terms name and the `<dd></dd>` tag to describe each term. For example [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_description) gives a perfect represeantation of what a Definition List looks like:

`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>A Description List</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>

</body>
</html>
