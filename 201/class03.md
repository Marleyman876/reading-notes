# Lists

There are different occasions why we use lists in coding, within HTML there are three different types of lists:

+ ## Ordered List

An ordered list has items listed sequentially and numbered in formats of 1,2,3... or in roman or alphabetically a,b,c.
An or dered lis in Html is indicated by the tags `<ol></ol>`. More infomation about ordered list is provided [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_ordered.asp).

+ ## Unordered List

An unorded list uses bullet points rather than characters that indicate an order.Unorded list arre started by the   `<ul></ul>` tags. More infomation about ordered list is provided [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists_unordered.asp).

+ ## Definition List

A definition list is made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. A definition list is indicated in HTML by adding the parent `<dl></dl>` and adding the  `<dt></dt>` tags to define the terms name and the `<dd></dd>` tag to describe each term.
