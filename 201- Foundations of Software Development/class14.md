# CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations

There are different types of transforms in HTML. Below are some of the transform Syntax for the transform property followed by the specific amount if parentheses; 
 `div{`
   `-webkit-transform: scale(1.5);`
     `-moz-transform: scale(1.5);`
      `-o-transform: scale(1.5);`
       `transform: scale(1.5);`
`}`

## 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth.

## 2D Rotate

The transform property also accepts different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.
