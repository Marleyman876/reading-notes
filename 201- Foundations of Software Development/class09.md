# Forms

Forms are one of the main points of interactions between a user and a website or application. By adding form to a website you allow the user to interact with the page via data input.

## Designing & Implementing a Form

It is always best to keep your form simple, as complicating and over engineering your form can cause bad user experience. To create a form the following elements are going to be needed within your HTML document `<form> <label> <input> <textarea> <button>`.

All forms  start with a `<form>` element, example `<form action="/string" method='string2></form>`.

this element formally defines a form and is the container element like a `<section>`. Attributes can be used within forms such as the action attribute which is used in the example above, this `action` attribute defines the URL where the forms collected data should be sent once it is submitted.

## Events

Events/DOM Events notify code of interesting things that happen within the code. Some of the most common categories of event can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).
