# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

In javascript an object is a stand-alone entity that has properties and type. Objects create a model for something that you can recognize in the real world. object and variable take on new names in objects.
In an object variables become properties, and functions become methods.You can access the properties in an object by using the `objectName.propertyName` dot-notation.

## Object Literals

A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package ([Dynamic Web Coding](https://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/object-literal/)).

## Document Object Model [DOM]

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content. There are different types of DOM's such as HTML doms which have an [SVG element interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).
