# First Reading Task

These few chapters in my opinion is a introduction to coding as well.

Alot of different versions of HTML are specified in the Extra Markup chapter such as HTML4, XHMTL10, HTMl5. I was speciaficcally surprised that HTML5 doesn't require closing tags probably becasue this is not a completed language.

Process and Design learning about process and design in 102 helped me to undersand this chapter even better. There's alot of little details that go into designing and learing how to do a wireframe is possibly the most essential of any great design.
