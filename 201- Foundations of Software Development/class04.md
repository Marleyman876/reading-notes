# Links

Links are the defining feature of the web page to another. Links are created using the `<a>` element. users can click anything between the `<a></a>` tag, this tag also use the `href`. You can also do links to specific folders, for example you can set a link exactly to where you want to find a specific file, this is called a relative URl. There a different relative link types I'll list two but you can read about all different ways to structure relative link type [here](https://www.webstix.com/knowledgebase/general/relative-links-vs-absolute-links/):

* Same Folder

The link to a file in the same folder just use the file name for eg this URL would lead to music reviews from the music homepage.`<a href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>`.

* Child Folder

To link a child folder you would use the name of the child folder followed by a "/" and then the file name. For eg: `<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>`.

## Directory Structure

On larger websites its a good idea to organize code by placing the code into different folders. These folders are called directories.

# Layout

Websites often display different headers and columns like in a magazine. Its always helpful to have a good understanding of how a layout HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
`<header>` - Defines a header for a document or a section
`<nav>` - Defines a set of navigation links
`<section>` - Defines a section in a document
`<article>` - Defines an independent, self-contained content
`<aside>` - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
`<footer>` - Defines a footer for a document or a section
`<details>` - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
`<summary>` - Defines a heading for the `<details>` element.
