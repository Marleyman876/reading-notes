# REST API

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.

You can think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what.

Another advantage of an API is that you don’t have to know the specifics of caching—how your resource is retrieved or where it comes from.

There are a many different types of API's for eg:

+ LocationIq.
+ Yelp
+ Movie DB
+ Weather
