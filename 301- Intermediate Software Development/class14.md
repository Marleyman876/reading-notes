# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

The article highlights the dominace of IT by field my men, although for decades women have been very prominent in the field of tech for a very long time. In the case of Patricia Ordóñez who's experience is recoreded in the article, she was given the opportunity due to her knowledge in math, however tech has chamged and though having a strong math based background may be helpful its not really necessary to thrive in tech today.

With males playing on computers while growin up you find alot more males are more technological incline and have the knoeledge to grow and lead tech teams because they have clear understanding of concepts and experience to go along with it.

## Three take aways from looking at the Data

1. Of the top 50 US companies Minority hires are at an all time low and minorities in today's society are super under employed by these companies.

2. Even though women make up 50% of the population, less than 50% of them are hired.

3. Although this data is pretty old I personally feel like not much has changed in 2021.

## Why does diversity Matter?

Diversity in tech will help to dull bias especically when you have culturaly competent people on board. which will reduce headaches and probably lawsuits.

It makes the workplace more vibrant and people can learn from different cultures and help spreadpositivity.

It helps to open up opportunity in poor and disenfranchised communities.
