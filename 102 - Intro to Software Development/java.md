# Java Script

+ Java helps to make a website more dynamic and interactive.
+ you can use it to create prompts on your webpage.
+ you can use defined variables anywhere in your script
+ There are alot of different elements to java scripting, you canuse it to create user prompts.
+ var variables are accessible anywhere in a code once it is outside a function. let variables are only accessible in their scope which they are used and nested scope within them.

 ``` Example:

 if true {
     let card = "poker"
     card = "texas holdem"
     if true{
         let rain = card
        console.log (card);
     }
     console.log (rain) //undefined
 }
 you can access card because it is access within an inner/nested scope but not rain as it is outside the nested scope it will be undefined.
 ```
