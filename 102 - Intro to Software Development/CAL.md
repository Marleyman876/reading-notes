# Computers and how they work

Computers have evolved over time becoming more and more interactive. 
The flow and processiong of information from input to out is all precisely calculated and conceptualized based on logic and the process they go through. 

A computer is a tool that was created to solve problems and help humans to "think less." The four things all computers have in common are that they: 
+ Take *input*
+ *Store* the inputted data
+ *Process* this data
+ Give and *output* that is logical

# Binary

Binary only has 2 digits (1,0). The position starts at 1 and it is self multiplied by the 10th power each time. Any number can be represented by (1,0), using just 8 wires or values of 1 you can store up to 255 wires, with 32 wires or 32, 1's tou can store up to 4billion wires. We can use binary to represent any number we like. Binary plays a significant role in even the letter and colors we use graphically.

# Circuits 

+ in order to have output computer has to combine modify and process input. 
+ Circuits perform calculation quickly and efficiently.

# Software/Hardware

One cannot perfom its task without the other. Software is code running on the machince it can be anything from webpage to apps and software. 
The CPU is the master chip, it need to do multiple things at once so it has different circuits for specific functions.
