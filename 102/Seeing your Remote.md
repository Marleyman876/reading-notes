# Seeing your Remote 

Colloboration is a big part of being a succesful coder. In order to be succesful at Code Fellows I personally will try yo learn as much as i can from my peers, TA
and Instructors alike. A remote repository is one that can be accessed from anywhere. There are different ways to see your remote, using specific commands. 

+ `git remote -v` allows you to view all remote URLS next to their names. 
+ `git fetch [remote-name]` allows you to pull data from a remote project. 
+ `git push [remote-name][branch name]` this command changes data in the name of the selected repository and all the way to the local "master branch."
