# Loops

+ A loop is a repetitive way of doing things within a code.  
+ There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)
+ Threee types *for* *while* *do while*
 An example of a working loop is shown below; 
 
 ```
 <script type = "text/javascript"> 
var i; 
  
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)  
{ 
    document.write("Hello World!\n"); 
} 
< /script> 
```
