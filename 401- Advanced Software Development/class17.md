# Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.

Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

Web scraping is used in a variety of digital businesses that rely on data harvesting. Legitimate use cases include:

1. Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.
2. Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
3. Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).

There can however be repurcussions in scraping a website that haspolicies against this therefore it is important we read the policies to ensure you arenot doing anything illelegal.
