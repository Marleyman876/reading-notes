# Encryption, Decryption and Hacking

The Caesar Cipher was one of the earlist methods of encrytion invented by [Julius Caesar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/caesar-cipher#:~:text=The%20Caesar%20cipher%20is%20a,as%20shown%20in%20Figure%205.1.). Also of people call Caesar the father of cryptography for this simple yet complicated was of encrytion that is still currently used today. The Caesar cipher is based on transposition and involves shifting each letter of the plaintext message by a certain number of letters.  The ciphertext can be decrypted by applying the same number of shifts in the opposite direction. This type of encryption is known as a substitution cipher, due to the substitution of one letter for another in a consistent fashion.

## Encryption Using the Caesar Cipher

Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:
SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE

Here's what that might look like encrypted:
YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK

That looks an awfully lot like gobbledygook at first, but this encrypted message is actually very related to the original text.
