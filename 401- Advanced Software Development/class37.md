# React

So from this reading I basically got a refresher on React, Bootstrap and an introduction to Tailwind CSS.

Tailwindf CSS:

* Tailwind’s flexbox and padding utilities (flex, flex-shrink-0, and p-6) to control the overall card layout

* The max-width and margin utilities (max-w-sm and mx-auto) to constrain the card width and center it horizontally

*The background color, border radius, and box-shadow utilities (bg-white, rounded-xl, and shadow-md) to style the card’s appearance

* The width and height utilities (w-12 and h-12) to size the logo image

* The space-between utilities (space-x-4) to handle the spacing between the logo and the text

* The font size, text color, and font-weight utilities (text-xl, text-black, font-medium, etc.) to style the card text

## But once you’ve actually built something this way, you’ll quickly notice some really important benefits:

* You aren’t wasting energy inventing class names. No more adding silly class names like sidebar-inner-wrapper just to be able to style something, and no more agonizing over the perfect abstract name for something that’s really just a flex container.

* Your CSS stops growing. Using a traditional approach, your CSS files get bigger every time you add a new feature. With utilities, everything is reusable so you rarely need to write new CSS.

* Making changes feels safer. CSS is global and you never know what you’re breaking when you make a change. Classes in your HTML are local, so you can change them without worrying about something else breaking.
