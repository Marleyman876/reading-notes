# Trees

A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

1. Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

2. K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

3. Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

4. Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

5. Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

6. Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

7. Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversing a Tree

The tree can be traversed by deciding on a sequence to visit each node. As we can clearly see we can start at a node then visit the left sub-tree first and right sub-tree next. Or we can also visit the right sub-tree first and left sub-tree next. Accordingly there are different names for these tree traversal methods. There are three ways which we use to traverse a tree.
