# Graphs

* A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

* Every relationship is an edge from one node to another

* More precisely, a graph is a data structure (V, E) that consists of

  A collection of vertices V
  
  A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)

## Graph Terminology

* Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them. Vertices 2 and 3 are not adjacent because there is no edge between them.

* Path: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path. 0-1, 1-2 and 0-2 are paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2.


* Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.
