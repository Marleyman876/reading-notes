# How to run Linear regression in Python

In statistics, regression is a technique that can be used to analyze the relationship between predictor variables and a response variable.

Linear regression is an approach to model the relationship between a single dependent variable (target variable) and one (simple regression) or more (multiple regression) independent variables.

There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
