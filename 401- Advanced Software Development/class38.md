# React 2

## [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

## [List and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

* Given the code below, we use the `map()` function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by `map()` to the variable doubled and log it.

## [Basic List Compnent](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of `numbers` and outputs a list of elements.
