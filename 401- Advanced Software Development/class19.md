# Regular Expression in Python & Shutil

Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing).

## Shutil -  High-level File Operations

The shutil module includes high-level file operations such as copying and archiving.

## Copying Files

copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

shutil_copyfile.py

```py

import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

```

### Working With Directory Trees

shutil includes three functions for working with directory trees. To copy a directory from one place to another, use copytree(). It recurses through the source directory tree, copying files to the destination. The destination directory must not exist in advance.

shutil_copytree.py

```py
import glob
import pprint
import shutil

print('BEFORE:')
pprint.pprint(glob.glob('/tmp/example/*'))

shutil.copytree('../shutil', '/tmp/example')

print('\nAFTER:')
pprint.pprint(glob.glob('/tmp/example/*'))

```

## Finding Files

The which() function scans a search path looking for a named file. The typical use case is to find an executable program on the shellâ€™s search path defined in the environment variable PATH.

```py 
shutil_which.py
import shutil

print(shutil.which('virtualenv'))
print(shutil.which('tox'))
print(shutil.which('no-such-program'))
If no file matching the search parameters can be found, which() returns None.

```
