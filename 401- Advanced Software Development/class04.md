# Classes & Objects

[Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

```py
a simple class would look like: 

class This_Class:
    var = "eggs"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a Class.")

```

Some Key oints on Classes in Python:

* Classes are created by keyword class

* A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

* When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class.
